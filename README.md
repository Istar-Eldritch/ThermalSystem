- Heat transfers from containers to contents and from contents to containers.
- Items stored in the body (tshirt & pants), will eventually reach 36C
- You can heat edibles on stoves
- Food will freeze if it goes under 0C
- Water will freeze if it goes under 0C
- You can't consume frozen foods or liquids
- Houses are warmer if external temperatures are below 20C and cooler if they are above 40C
- Vehicles are warmer if external temperatures are below 20C and cooler if they are above 40C
- Items in the players backpack will track ambient temperature. (will heat close to a campfire, we warmer inside etc)

Planned: 
- Items under 20C in a body part will reduce the heat of the wearer.
- Items over 40C in a body part will increase heat of the wearer
- Heat radiates from items if they are really hot (threshold to be defined), warming other items and players in their vecinity.
- More realistic heat transfer logic using mass and thermal capacity of objects.
- Configuration files to allow control over all the variables.
- Skinning animals yields items at ~35C
- Mod compatibility (rag inmmersive vehicles)
